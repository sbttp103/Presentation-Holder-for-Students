# Team1Project6

## In this project, we build a website for reviewing student presentations.

### Functions:
1. Create admin/student accounts
2. Difference views:
- Instructor view: create events, add grade, read student feedbacks, etc
- Student view: find all events created, add feedbacks to any of them, read feedback of presentation


### Instructions
If you want to access our website, just simply open the terminal, relocate to file "Project6" and enter the following command in terminal:
1. Create and migrate the database and install the gems
```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
bundle
```
2. Now, if you encounter some issues like webpack error, you can run:
```
bundle exec rake assets:precompile
rails assets:precompile
```
3. Then, you can enter to start the server
```
rails s
```

4. If below info shows up, it means you have successfully connected to the rails server

5. You can now enter in your web browser and add your feedback/create events!
```
localhost:3000
```

6. Create student/presentor account:
Simply click the sign up button, you can create an account as in any other website.

7. Create instructor account:
The very first step is the same with creating a student account.
Then, we need to go to database and set the account as an admin account.
go to terminal, enter:
```
rails c # open rails terminal
User.all # See the user you have
@usr = User.find(1) # Find the user you want to set as admin by user_id, you can also user User.last to get the newest user.
@usr.add_role “admin” # set admin
@usr.save # save the change to database
```
Now, your account will become an officially instroctor account. You can now create event, give grade to presenter's presentation.

8. If you want to end the server, press 'ctrl-c'  in terminal, if following info shows, it means you have successfully disconnected.
